# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, promise to ensure that everyone can participate in our community without experiencing harassment. We welcome people of all backgrounds and characteristics, regardless of their age, physical appearance, disabilities, ethnicity, gender, experience level, education, economic status, nationality, personal style, race, caste, color, religion, sexual identity, or orientation.

Our commitment is to engage with one another in a manner that fosters an open, inviting, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct is in effect in all community spaces. It also applies when someone officially represents the community in public spaces. For instance, if you're using an official email address, posting on an official social media account, or acting as a chosen representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the project’s code of conduct.

If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their disputes. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

Reports should be directed to Janvi Bajoria, [janvibajo1@gmail.com](janvibajo1@gmail.com), the Project Steward(s) for SQL-Editor. It is the Project Steward’s duty to receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct.
