# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, promise to ensure that everyone can participate in our community without experiencing harassment. We welcome people of all backgrounds and characteristics, regardless of their age, physical appearance, disabilities, ethnicity, gender, experience level, education, economic status, nationality, personal style, race, caste, color, religion, sexual identity, or orientation.

Our commitment is to engage with one another in a manner that fosters an open, inviting, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Our community leaders have a vital role in upholding our standards of behavior. They will ensure that everyone follows the rules and will take fair actions if someone acts in a way that's not right, harmful, or offensive.

These leaders have the authority to remove or modify comments, code changes, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't follow this Code of Conduct. They will also explain their decisions if necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct is in effect in all community spaces. It also applies when someone officially represents the community in public spaces. For instance, if you're using an official email address, posting on an official social media account, or acting as a chosen representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

If you come across any abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior, please report it to our community leader responsible for enforcement.

We take every complaint seriously and will promptly and fairly review and investigate all reports.
